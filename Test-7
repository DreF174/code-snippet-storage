# Step 1. Create a new `Problem` instance. This will be the object where you define your variables and constraints.
problem = Problem()

# Step 2. Identify the LSAT game type and explain why.
# This game type is a grouping game because the participants are scientists being put into groups, a group for those selected and a group for those not selected.

# Step 3. Identify and define the variables and their domains
# The variables are the scientists. We further define the variables as botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
scientists = ["F", "G", "H", "K", "L", "M", "P", "Q", "R"]

# Identify and define the domains. 
# The domains are the groups: selected and not_selected
groups= ["selected", "not_selected"]

#Step 4. # Identify any domains that require ordering and create a dictionary mapping numbers to the objects in the domain.
# In this case none the question does not require ordering, so we will not create a dictionary mapping numbers to the objects in the domain.

# Step 5. Add variables and domains to the problem
