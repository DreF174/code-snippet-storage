#Before starting, import the `constraint` python module:
from constraint import Problem

# Step 1. Create a new `Problem` instance. This will be the object where you define your variables and constraints.
problem = Problem()

# Step 2. Identify the LSAT game type and explain why.
# This game type is a grouping game because the participants are riders being separated into groups of bicycles given certain rules and constraints.

# Step 3. Identify and define the variables.
#The variables are the riders delimited by the day they test the bicycle.
riders = ['Reynaldo_Day1', 'Seamus_Day1', 'Theresa_Day1', 'Yuki_Day1', 'Reynaldo_Day2', 'Seamus_Day2', 'Theresa_Day2', 'Yuki_Day2']
#The domains are the bicycles.
bikes = ['F', 'G', 'H', 'J']

#Step 4. # Identify any domains that require ordering and create a dictionary mapping numbers to the objects in the domain.
# In this case, the question is a simple grouping game and the bicycles do not need to be ordered, so we will not create a dictionary mapping numbers to the bicycles.

# Step 5. Add variables and domains to the problem
for rider in riders:
    problem.addVariable(rider, bikes)
    
# Step 6. Add the orignal constraints, including any contained in the question. Each rule translates to a constraint in your problem.

#Rule 1: Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
