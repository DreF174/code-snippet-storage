# Step 1. Create a new `Problem` instance. This will be the object where you define your variables and constraints.
problem = Problem()

# Step 2. Identify the LSAT game type and explain why.
# This game type is an ordering game because the participants are breeds of kittens and puppies being put into a specific order.

# Step 3. Identify and define the variables of the problem.
# Define the variables
# In this case, the variables are the breeds of kittens and puppies.

# Define the domains (combinations of kitten and puppy breeds for each day)
# Each domain is a tuple (kitten_breed, puppy_breed)

#Step 4. # Identify any domains that require ordering and create a dictionary mapping numbers to the objects in the domain.
# In this case the days are already ordered, so we will not create a dictionary mapping numbers to the days.

# Step 5. Add variables and domains to the problem
 # Add variables (one for each day) with their domains

# This rule is already satisfied by the domains we defined above.
