# Task: You are an expert in translating LSAT Logic Games into python using the python constraint library. Your task is to generate the code for a python constraint satisfaction problem following the ten steps as follows. Make sure you add  comments to your code. The following logic games have been provided as examples.

# There are 7 different types of LSAT logic games: ordering games, grouping games, and assignment games.

#Relative-Ordering: Ordering a set of variables relative to each other. Simple-Ordering: Ordering a set of variables relative to fixed positions. Comple-Ordering: Ordering two or more sets of variables relative to fixed positions.

#In/Out-Grouping: Assigning each entity to exacrtly one of two groups primarily through the application of conditional statements. Distribution-Grouping: Assigning each entity to exactly one of a given number of groups. 

#Determined-Assignment: The exact number of each variable to be placed in the diagram can be deduced from the setup and conditions. Undetermined-Assignment: The exact number of each variable to be placed in the diagram is left open by the setup and conditions and can vary from question to question.
# Constraint satisfaction problems are a type of problem that require you to assign values to variables in order to satisfy a set of constraints.
# Variables are the objects that you are assigning values to. 
# Domains are the possible values that can be assigned to a variable.

# The following are step-by-step examples of how to translate LSAT logic games into constraint satisfaction problems in Python.


#Before starting, import the `constraint` python module

from constraint import Problem

# Step 1: Create a new Problem instance
problem = Problem()

# Step 2: There are 7 game types as follows: Relative Ordering, Simple Ordering, Complex Ordering, In/Out Grouping, Grouping Distribution, Determined assignment and UNdetermined assignment.

# Passage: Seven directors -A, B, C, D, E, F and G- serves on the X committee or the Y committee. If A serves on X, then B serves on Y.  If C serves on X, then D and E serve on Y. F serves on a different committee with G. E serves on a different committee with A. If G serves on X, so does B.\n# Question: If D and F both serve on the X committee, then which one of the following could be true? Options: \"A and C both serve on the X committee.\" \"A and E both serve on the Y committee.\" \"B and G both serve on the X committee.\" \"C and E both serve on the Y committee.\" \"G and E both serve on the X committee.
#From reading the passage, we can discern that the variables we will be working with will be "A,B,C,D,E,F,G" As "Directors" and "1, 2" As the committees for the directors to be placed in:
# Step 3: Identify and define the variables
directors = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']
# Define the domains
committees = [1, 2]  # 1 for X, 2 for Y

# Step 4: Add variables and domains to the problem
for director in directors:
    problem.addVariable(director, committees)

# After reading the passage, you will need to follow the information it gave you to properly create the constraints required to solve the problem:
# Step 5: Add the original constraints Each rule translates to a constraint in your problem.

# Rule 2: If A serves on X (1), then B serves on Y (2)
problem.addConstraint(lambda a, b: b == 2 if a == 1 else True, ('A', 'B'))
# Rule 3: If C serves on X (1), then D and E serve on Y (2)
problem.addConstraint(lambda c, d, e: all([d == 2, e == 2]) if c == 1 else True, ('C', 'D', 'E'))
# Rule 4: F serves on a different committee with G
problem.addConstraint(lambda f, g: f != g, ('F', 'G'))
# Rule 5: E serves on a different committee with A
problem.addConstraint(lambda e, a: e != a, ('E', 'A'))
# Rule 6: If G serves on X (1), so does B
problem.addConstraint(lambda g, b: b == 1 if g == 1 else True, ('G', 'B'))

# After creating the constraints, make sure to create the function to determine the possible solutions to the question:

# Step 6: Identify any rules/Constraints in the question.

# Step 7: Determine is all possible solutions that exist after applying the original rules and any rules contained in the question. These rules and constraints will be assumed and imposed on the answer choices.
solutions = problem.getSolutions()

# Step 8: Determine the type of answer the question calls for. The answer will be one from the list: Relative Ordering, Simple Ordering, Complex Ordering, In/Out Grouping, Grouping Distribution, Determined assignment and Undetermined assignment.

# Step 9: Determine the correct answer by creating a function for each possible answer choice in order to determine whether each answer choice is true or false.
def answer_checker(question_constraint, answer_constraint):
    for solution in solutions:
        if question_constraint(solution):
            if answer_constraint(solution):
                return True
    return False

#Then you create the question constraint that MUST be followed, and create the functions for each possible answer to see if it will be marked as true or false:
question_constraint = lambda sol: sol['D'] == 1 and sol['F'] == 1  # D and F both serve on X

# Answer A: A and C both serve on the X committee
answer_a_constraint = lambda sol: sol['A'] == 1 and sol['C'] == 1
print(str(answer_checker(question_constraint, answer_a_constraint)) + ' - Answer A: A and C both serve on the X committee.')

# Answer B: A and E both serve on the Y committee
answer_b_constraint = lambda sol: sol['A'] == 2 and sol['E'] == 2
print(str(answer_checker(question_constraint, answer_b_constraint)) + ' - Answer B: A and E both serve on the Y committee.')

# Answer C: B and G both serve on the X committee
answer_c_constraint = lambda sol: sol['B'] == 1 and sol['G'] == 1
print(str(answer_checker(question_constraint, answer_c_constraint)) + ' - Answer C: B and G both serve on the X committee.')

# Answer D: C and E both serve on the Y committee
answer_d_constraint = lambda sol: sol['C'] == 2 and sol['E'] == 2
print(str(answer_checker(question_constraint, answer_d_constraint)) + ' - Answer D: C and E both serve on the Y committee.')

# Answer E: G and E both serve on the X committee
answer_e_constraint = lambda sol: sol['G'] == 1 and sol['E'] == 1
print(str(answer_checker(question_constraint, answer_e_constraint)) + ' - Answer E: G and E both serve on the X committee.')
