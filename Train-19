#Before starting, import the `constraint` python module:
from constraint import Problem

# Identify the question: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel MUST include either

# Identify the original rules and constraints in the problem, including any constraints contained in the question:

#Rule 1: A panel of five scientists will be formed.
#Rule 2: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
#Rule 3: If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
#Rule 4: F and K cannot both be selected.
#Rule 5: K and M cannot both be selected.
#Rule 6: If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
#Question Rule: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel MUST include either

# Step 1. Identify each of the answer choices:
#Answer A: F or else K
#Answer B: F or else M
#Answer C: K or else M
#Answer D: M or else Q
#Answer E: P or else Q

# Step 2. Create a new `Problem` instance. This will be the object where you define your variables and constraints.
problem = Problem()

# Step 3. Identify the LSAT game type and explain why.
# This game type is a grouping game because the participants are scientists being put into groups, a group for those selected and a group for those not selected.

# Step 4. Identify and define the variables and their domains
# The variables are the scientists. We further define the variables as botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
scientists = ["F", "G", "H", "K", "L", "M", "P", "Q", "R"]
botanists = ["F", "G", "H"]
chemists = ["K", "L", "M"]
zoologists = ["P", "Q", "R"]
# Identify and define the domains.
# The domains are the groups: selected and not_selected
groups= ["selected", "not_selected"]

#Step 5. # Identify any domains that require ordering and create a dictionary mapping numbers to the objects in the domain.
# In this case none the question does not require ordering, so we will not create a dictionary mapping numbers to the objects in the domain.

# Step 6. Add variables and domains to the problem
for scientist in scientists:
    problem.addVariable(scientist, groups)
    
# Step 7. Add the orignal constraints. Each rule translates to a constraint in your problem.
